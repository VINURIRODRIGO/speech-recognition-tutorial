You are my fire the one desire believe when I want it that way but we are to work apart can't reach to your heart when you say that I want it that way tell me why I never want to hear say I want it that way in my mind you're fire your one, it's too late. But I won't be back away tell me why it ain't nothing but ain't nothing but a place to say tell me why I never want to hear say I want it away now I can see that we've fallen apart from the way that it used to be no matter the distance I want you know that desire might fire the world desire you are I want it sight away because I won't need that away.
